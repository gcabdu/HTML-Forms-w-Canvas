# HTML-Forms-w-Canvas

## Description
The HTML-Forms-w-Canvas project utilizes HTML forms and P5.js to enable a minimum of five input types that control the canvas. These inputs include text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, select lists, and range sliders. For example, a text field might control the number of objects displayed, a checkbox might be used to pause/unpause or reset the animation, and a slider could be used to adjust the speed, size, or color of the animated objects. This project demonstrates how user interactions with HTML forms can dynamically influence animations on a canvas.

## Features
- Interactive HTML forms to control canvas animations
- Use of text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, select lists, and range sliders
- Real-time updates and animations with P5.js
- Object-Oriented Programming structure

## Prerequisites
- Web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
- Basic understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
